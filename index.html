<p class="am">Hi, <b> I am Muhammad Shumail Baig,</b> Moved to London from Pakistan in 2010. At a young age I used to appreciate dismantling things to perceive 
    how they function, and my enthusiasm for computer interfaces peaked especially when I was young, as time went and new innovation
    was produced by significant organizations, for example, Apple and Microsoft.
    I used to worked in a travel sector and always facinated by the technology used by the industry, it made me become more intrigued
    to see how these interfaces function, the technology behind computer interfaces and the philosophy of how they function.
    I would like to learn how software is developed, that is one of the reason I enrolled my self in CodeNation Course.
    I think that itâ€™s astonishing to look as the advanced transformation of technology shapes society; there is such a great amount
    to still be discovered.</p>
